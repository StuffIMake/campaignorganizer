# Playwright Testing Implementation Plan

## 1. Goal

Implement End-to-End (E2E) testing using Playwright to ensure critical user flows function correctly in a browser environment.

## 2. Assessment

A search for existing test files (`.test.ts[x]`, `.spec.ts[x]`) within the `src` directory yielded no results. This plan focuses on setting up Playwright from scratch and writing new E2E tests.

## 3. Define E2E Testing Strategy

*   **Identify Critical User Flows:** Determine the most important paths a user takes through the application. Examples might include:
    *   Loading the main map view.
    *   Interacting with map features (panning, zooming, clicking markers).
    *   Navigating between different sections/pages.
    *   User authentication (if applicable).
    *   Data submission/creation flows.
*   **Prioritize Flows:** Select the most critical flows to implement tests for first.
*   **Target Browsers:** Decide which browsers Playwright should test against (e.g., Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). This is configured in `playwright.config.ts`.

## 4. Set Up Playwright

*   **Install Dependency:** Add Playwright as a development dependency.
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install --save-dev @playwright/test

    # Or using yarn
    yarn add --dev @playwright/test
    ```
*   **Initialize Playwright & Install Browsers:** Run the install command to download the necessary browser binaries.
    ```bash
    npx playwright install
    ```
    This command might also prompt you to create a `playwright.config.ts` file if one doesn't exist.
*   **Configure `playwright.config.ts`:**
    *   Set the `baseURL` for your application (e.g., `http://localhost:5173` if using Vite's default).
    *   Define `projects` for different browsers or configurations if needed.
    *   Configure test reporters (e.g., 'html' for an HTML report).

## 5. Implement Playwright Tests

*   **Create Test Directory:** Establish a convention for storing Playwright tests. A common practice is to create an `e2e/` or `tests/` directory at the root of the project.
*   **Write Tests:** Create `.spec.ts` files within your chosen test directory. Use the Playwright API to script user interactions:
    *   `test('description', async ({ page }) => { ... });`
    *   `await page.goto('/');` - Navigate to pages.
    *   `await page.locator('button#submit').click();` - Find elements and interact.
    *   `await page.locator('input#username').fill('user');` - Fill input fields.
    *   `await expect(page.locator('.welcome-message')).toBeVisible();` - Make assertions about the page state.
*   **Page Object Model (POM):** Consider using the Page Object Model pattern for better test organization and maintainability, especially as the test suite grows. Create classes representing pages or components and encapsulate their selectors and interaction logic.

## 6. CI/CD Integration

*   **Update Pipeline:** Modify your Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) configuration:
    *   Add a step to install Playwright dependencies (`npm ci` or `yarn install`).
    *   Add a step to install Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install --with-deps` (the `--with-deps` flag helps install OS dependencies).
    *   Add a step to run the Playwright tests: `npx playwright test`.
*   **Test Reports:** Configure your CI/CD pipeline to archive or publish the Playwright test reports (e.g., the HTML report) for easy viewing.

## 7. Documentation

*   Keep this document updated as the testing strategy evolves.
*   Add guidelines and best practices for writing new Playwright tests specific to this project.
