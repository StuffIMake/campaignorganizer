# Playwright Implementation Progress

## Steps Completed
- [x] Install Playwright dependencies
- [x] Initialize Playwright and install browsers
- [x] Configure playwright.config.ts
- [x] Create test directory structure
- [x] Implement initial tests
- [x] Update package.json with test scripts
- [x] Add navigation test
- [x] CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- [x] Add Characters page test
- [x] Add Map page test

## Current Progress
1. âœ… Successfully installed @playwright/test package with --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve dependency conflicts.
2. âœ… Installed Chromium browser for Playwright using `npx playwright install`.
3. âœ… Created playwright.config.ts with appropriate configuration for the project:
   - Set baseURL to http://localhost:3000
   - Configured Chromium as the primary browser
   - Set up webServer to start the development server during tests
4. âœ… Created the e2e directory structure with:
   - e2e/home.spec.ts - Basic test for the home page
   - e2e/pages/HomePage.ts - Page Object Model for the home page
5. âœ… Added Playwright test scripts to package.json:
   - `npm run test:e2e` - Run all Playwright tests
   - `npm run test:e2e:debug` - Run tests in debug mode
   - `npm run test:e2e:ui` - Run tests with UI
   - `npm run test:e2e:report` - Show test reports
6. âœ… Successfully ran the initial test with `npx playwright test` and it passed!
7. âœ… Added navigation test for verifying page routing:
   - Tests navigation from home to the Map view
   - Tests navigation back to home
   - Both tests pass successfully
8. âœ… Created GitHub Actions workflow for CI integration:
   - Set up to run on push to main/master branches and pull requests
   - Configured to install dependencies with --legacy-peer-deps
   - Set to install Playwright browsers with OS dependencies
   - Configured to upload test reports as artifacts
9. âœ… Added Characters page test:
   - Created e2e/pages/CharactersPage.ts Page Object Model
   - Created e2e/characters.spec.ts test file
   - Successfully tested navigation to the Characters page
   - Verified key UI elements on the Characters page
10. âœ… Added Map page test:
    - Created e2e/pages/MapPage.ts Page Object Model
    - Created e2e/map.spec.ts test file
    - Successfully tested navigation to the Map page
    - Added robust handling for map interactions (zoom, pan)
    - Tests pass successfully on the Map page

## Implementation Summary
- **Total Time Spent**: Approximately 3-4 hours
- **Total Tests Created**: 4 (home page loading, navigation, characters page, map page)
- **Total Page Objects**: 3 (HomePage, CharactersPage, MapPage)
- **Test Framework**: Playwright with TypeScript
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow
- **Test Coverage**: Basic navigation and interaction tests for key application features

## Next Steps
1. ðŸ”„ Continue expanding test coverage:
   - Add more complex form interaction tests
   - Test data persistence functionality 
   - Add visual regression tests if needed
   - Test other key features like Locations, Combat, etc.
2. ðŸ”„ Add more detailed documentation for the testing strategy
3. ðŸ”„ Monitor CI/CD pipeline execution and refine as needed

## Final Notes
The Playwright migration has been successfully implemented. The test suite now covers basic navigation and interaction with key application pages. All tests are passing and the CI/CD pipeline is configured for automated testing. This provides a solid foundation for continued expansion of the test suite.
