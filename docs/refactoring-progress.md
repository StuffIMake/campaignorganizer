### Next Steps

1. **Complete testing infrastructure**
   - Add more tests for hooks and components
   - Fix testing for React components that require proper React context
   - Implement mock store for testing store-dependent components

2. **Implement audio tracks slice**
   - Create `audioSlice.ts` with audio-specific state logic
   - Refactor audio playback functionality to use the store slice
   - Add tests for audio state management

3. **Improve application performance**
   - Optimize component re-renders with React.memo
   - Use memoized selectors for store access
   - Implement virtualized lists for large data sets

4. **Complete documentation**
   - Document remaining components and hooks
   - Add inline comments for complex logic
   - Create feature-level README files
