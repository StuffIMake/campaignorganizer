# Refactoring Update

This document tracks recent progress in the ongoing refactoring of the Pen & Paper Project codebase according to the [refactoring plan](../Refactor.MD) and [refactoring next steps](./refactoring_next_steps.md).

## Immediate Priorities Progress - Completed! âœ…

### Refactored `ActiveCombatView.tsx`
- [x] Moved the component from `src/components/ActiveCombatView.tsx` to `src/features/combats/views/ActiveCombatView.tsx`
- [x] Extracted UI sections into smaller, dedicated components:
  - [x] `CombatParticipantList`: Displays the list of initiative-ordered participants
  - [x] `CombatParticipantDetails`: Shows detailed information about selected participants
  - [x] `AddParticipantDialog`: Dialog for adding new characters to combat
- [x] Extracted state management and combat logic into enhanced `useCombatSession` hook
  - [x] Added participant management (add, remove, update)
  - [x] Added turn tracking and initiative handling
  - [x] Added participant selection and details viewing
  - [x] Integrated audio management for combat sounds
- [x] Updated imports and references in related components
- [x] Deleted the original component file after successful refactoring

### Moved Type Definitions from Store
- [x] Restructured type definitions to use proper type files:
  - [x] `CustomLocation`: Now exported from `src/types/location.ts` with proper type annotations
  - [x] `Character`: Now exported from `src/types/character.ts` with enhanced properties
  - [x] `Item`: Now exported from `src/types/character.ts` as an inventory item
  - [x] `Combat`: Now exported from `src/types/combat.ts` with more detailed structure
- [x] Added backward compatibility with type re-exports
- [x] Enhanced type definitions with:
  - [x] Better JSDoc comments
  - [x] More specific property types
  - [x] Related type definitions (e.g., `CharacterType`, `DescriptionType`)
- [x] Updated the store to import types instead of defining them inline
- [x] Ensured type-safety throughout the import/export chain

### Refactored Global Store Logic
- [x] Created map feature slice for map-related state:
  - [x] Created `src/features/map/store/mapSlice.ts` with map-specific state and actions
  - [x] Moved `mapConfig` to the map slice
  - [x] Moved `selectedLocationId` state to the map slice
  - [x] Moved `currentLocation` state to the map slice
  - [x] Added `updateMapConfig` action for better control of map settings
  - [x] Added `setCurrentLocationById` action to set the current location based on ID
- [x] Integrated new map slice into the main store
- [x] Removed redundant map state properties (`mapConfig`, `selectedLocationId`, `currentLocation`) and methods (`setCurrentLocation`, `setSelectedLocationId`) from the root `useStore` definition.
- [x] Added `fetchLocations` and `fetchCharacters` actions to their respective slices and updated `initializeStore` to use them.
- [x] Refined `setCurrentLocationById` in `mapSlice` to correctly access `locations` state.
- [x] Updated type definitions to properly combine all slices and ensure correct state access within slices.

## Ongoing Enhancements

With the immediate refactoring priorities completed, the focus shifts to the ongoing enhancements outlined in [`refactoring_next_steps.md`](./refactoring_next_steps.md):

1.  **Expand Test Coverage:** Continue adding unit and integration tests.
2.  **Performance Optimization:** Profile and optimize component rendering.
3.  **Complete Documentation:** Finish JSDoc and README coverage.
4.  **Review Asset Management:** Analyze and potentially integrate `assetManager.ts` further.
5.  **UI Component Consistency:** Review and refactor UI component usage.
